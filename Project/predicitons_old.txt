(2007: 2009). two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. when people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for self, other and situation are met or not met. people can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. these four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. these more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of",

is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. this is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. these

compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. on 10 november 2014, president barack obama recommended that the fcc reclassify broadband internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. on 16 january 2015, republicans presented legislation, in the form of a u.s. congress h.r. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the fcc from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting internet service providers. on 31 january
