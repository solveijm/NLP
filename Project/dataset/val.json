In 1996 it became the island's first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project which was established in 2002 to replant part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust. When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island's hinterland must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced, and native species have been adversely affected as a result. The dramatic change in landscape must be attributed to these introductions. As a result, the string tree (Acalypha rubrinervis) and the St Helena olive (Nesiota elliptica) are now extinct, and many of the other endemic plants are threatened with extinction.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 56, "text": "47"}], "question": "How many square miles is Saint Helena?", "id": "56e06714231d4119001ac09f"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 112, "text": "volcanic"}], "question": "What kind of rock are coastal regions of Saint Helena covered with?", "id": "56e06714231d4119001ac0a0"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 333, "text": "2,684"}], "question": "How many feet high is the highest peak of Saint Helena?", "id": "56e06714231d4119001ac0a1"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 347, "text": "1996"}], "question": "What year did Diana's Peak officially become a state park?", "id": "56e06714231d4119001ac0a2"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 559, "text": "Millennium Forest project"}], "question": "What was formed in 2002 to replant parts of the great wood?", "id": "56e06714231d4119001ac0a3"}]}, {"context": "There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre (0.62 miles) of the shore.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 475, "text": "one kilometre"}], "question": "How close are the rockets and islets off the coast?", "id": "56e067a27aa994140058e453"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 137, "text": "South"}], "question": "Which direction from the island is Upper Black Rock located?", "id": "56e067a27aa994140058e454"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 158, "text": "Southwest"}], "question": "Which direction from the island is Bird Island located?", "id": "56e067a27aa994140058e455"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 263, "text": "West"}], "question": "Which direction from the island is Lighter Rock located?", "id": "56e067a27aa994140058e456"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 439, "text": "Southeast"}], "question": "Which direction from the island is Frightus Rock located?", "id": "56e067a27aa994140058e457"}]}, {"context": "The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena plover, known locally as the wirebird.

When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents.

Mass arrests and searches of homes (in most cases conducted without warrants) began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps (usually without the permission of War Relocation Authority officials) and grooming informants in order to monitor dissidents and \"troublemakers.\" After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3, "text": "1939"}], "question": "When did the Bureau begin compiling a custodial detention list?", "id": "570c2e976b8089140040fbdc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 119, "text": "in the event of war with Axis"}], "question": "When would the people on the custodial detention list be arrested?", "id": "570c2e976b8089140040fbdd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 208, "text": "Issei community leaders"}], "question": "Who were the majority of names on the custodial detention list?", "id": "570c2e976b8089140040fbde"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 571, "text": "December 7, 1941"}], "question": "When was Pearl Harbor bombed?", "id": "570c2e976b8089140040fbdf"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1380, "text": "Japanese Americans"}], "question": "What group did the FBI continue surveillance on?", "id": "570c2e976b8089140040fbe0"}]}, {"context": "In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program.

On average, summer is the driest season, with only occasional thunderstorm activity, and the wettest months are from October to January, with December the wettest single month, with nearly 165 millimetres of precipitation on average. This winter precipitation maximum is quite unusual for humid continental climates, which most commonly have a late spring or early summer precipitation maximum (for example, most of the Midwestern U.S.). Most heavy precipitation events in St. John's are the product of intense mid-latitude storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S. and New England states, and these are most common and intense from October to March, bringing heavy precipitation (commonly 4 to 8 centimetres of rainfall equivalent in a single storm), and strong winds. In winter, two or more types of precipitation (rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow) can fall from passage of a single storm. Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 335 centimetres per winter season. However, winter storms can bring changing precipitation types. Heavy snow can transition to heavy rain, melting the snow cover, and possibly back to snow or ice (perhaps briefly) all in the same storm, resulting in little or no net snow accumulation.

The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \"affirmative action\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people.

Texas banning any use of race in school admissions, the State of Texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top 10% of their graduating class. Florida and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self. The top 10% rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns. The class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative action: opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted had the given school used a holistic, merit-based approach. From 1996 to 1998, Texas had merit-based admission to its state universities, and minority enrollment dropped.

The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign.

Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown section. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, \"love\" or \"friendship\", and adelphos, \"brother\"). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots.

One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 247, "text": "Molotov"}], "question": "Who was ordered to remove the Jews from the Ministry?", "id": "5726dfa9708984140094d44b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "Stalin"}], "question": "Who gave the order to remove the Jews from the Ministry?", "id": "5726dfa9708984140094d44c"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1535, "text": "Derek Watson"}], "question": "Who believed that the firing of Litvinov allowed the Soviets to quicker negotiations with Germany?", "id": "5726dfa9708984140094d44d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1720, "text": "Geoffrey Roberts"}], "question": "Who believed that the hiring of Molotov would result in a better deal with the western countries?", "id": "5726dfa9708984140094d44e"}]}, {"context": "Edward Hallett Carr, a frequent defender of Soviet policy, stated: \"In return for 'non-intervention' Stalin secured a breathing space of immunity from German attack.\"[page needed] According to Carr, the \"bastion\" created by means of the Pact, \"was and could only be, a line of defense against potential German attack.\"[page needed] According to Carr, an important advantage was that \"if Soviet Russia had eventually to fight Hitler, the Western Powers would already be involved.\"[page needed] However, during the last decades, this view has been disputed.

General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 17, "text": "1800"}], "question": "In what year did Napoleon and his troops cross the Swiss Alps and enter Italy?", "id": "572679afdd62a815002e8666"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 511, "text": "Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na"}], "question": "Who led the French army defending Genoa against the Austrian siege?", "id": "572679afdd62a815002e8667"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 741, "text": "June 14"}], "question": " What was the date of the Battle of Marengo?", "id": "572679afdd62a815002e8668"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 750, "text": "General Melas"}], "question": "Who led the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo?", "id": "572679afdd62a815002e8669"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 856, "text": "24,000"}], "question": "How many troops did Napoleon field at the Battle of Marengo?", "id": "572679afdd62a815002e866a"}]}, {"context": "Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.

He made French the only official language. He left some primary education in the hands of religious orders, but he offered public support to secondary education. Napoleon founded a number of state secondary schools (lyc\u00e9es) designed to produce a standardized education that was uniform across France.

Unlike the system during the Ancien R\u00e9gime, religious topics did not dominate the curriculum, although they were present in addition to teachers from the clergy. Napoleon simply hoped to use religion to produce social stability. He gave special attention to the advanced centers, notably the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, that provided both military expertise and state-of-the-art research in science.
